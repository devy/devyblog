              Hello World, I'm Lynzie, a twenty-something-year-old woman who codes. I'm a whovian, and secretly a platypus.
              This blog will be where I update my educational goals and document my experiences. I will share tips and stradgeties 
              along the way, as well as a view of my progress.
